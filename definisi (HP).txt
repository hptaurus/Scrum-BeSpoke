ICQ LLC is an instant messaging computer program that was first developed and popularized by the Israeli company Mirabilis, which was acquired by America Online (AOL), and since April 2010 owned by Mail.Ru Group.

The first version of the program was released in November 1996 and ICQ became the first of the so-called "instant messaging" services, later patenting the technology.[1] IRC significantly predated ICQ but was never referred to as an "instant messenger" although all messages are instantly sent. The most significant difference was that ICQ was 1-on-1 chat only whereas IRC facilitates both individual and group chat. ICQ gained the ability to conduct group chat significantly later but its implementation is primitive compared to that of IRC, notably requiring a single user to create the group chat and invite others to join, as opposed to IRC wherein any user can choose to join a chat channel that is not designated as private. AOL acquired Mirabilis on June 8, 1998, for $287 million in cash up front and $120 million in additional payments over three years.[2]

In 2001, ICQ had over 100 million accounts registered.[3] In April 2010, AOL sold ICQ to Digital Sky Technologies for $187.5 million.
